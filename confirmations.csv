Since buildings represent the environments in which humans spend the majority of their time, understanding this interaction is a critical factor when it comes to enhancing the overall well-being of humans.
As an architect, I continuously think how better buildings can be designed. As a researcher, I think about what better buildings mean by considering their performance and impact on occupants. Hence, I envision Virtual Reality as a bridge that allows finding answers to these questions simultaneously.
I have been fascinated with the relationship between Architecture and Acoustics which lead me to study Aural Architecture as part of my current Ph.D. dissertation. This emerging field integrates the study of sound propagation in a space with the user experience of the acoustical environment. Virtual reality applications allow for exploring a variety of acoustical environments through modeling multiple design solutions and examining the user experience in each scenario. Analyzing these environments helps in predicting the building performance and enhances the design decision making. At the same time, it contributes to the development of VR through studying the differences between real and virtual environment experiences.
Joining the Reality Virtually Community will create a platform from which I can both contribute in terms of my academic and professional experience in acoustics and sound perception while also learning from others’ experiences in VR. Through interacting in interdisciplinary teams, as part of an inclusive and diverse community, we will work to advance knowledge in VR technology, and think of possible applications that can solve complicated issues related to user experience.

Ever since then, my development philosophies have changed. Instead of just gaming or entertainment purposes, I've spent a lot of time think and creating ways that AR and VR can be used in other ways, like teaching tools across multiple fields of work.

My current project is Teleportal, an XR Telepresence Platform I founded, which utilizes multiple smartphone sensors (including SLAM, GPS, camera, and gyroscope), and a cloud connection to a remote server, to deliver an accurate, real-world gaming and collaboration experience, across AR, VR, Mobile, and Desktop. It is funded by Lightspeed Venture Partners (Menlo Park, CA) and the first prototypes have launched on the App Store and Google Play. I serve as the CTO and am working on this with my close friend and technical artist Ryan Reede.

I have been working with immersive technologies since 2013, when I was prototyping my own smart glasses (with Raspberry Pi and custom PCBs) called Tiger. In 2014, I joined the Google Glass Explorer program, began using the hardware in everyday life, and wrote open-source Glassware. When Google launched ARCore, I modified the binary and library to run on previously-unsupported devices, and published the research to GitHub. This “ARCore-for-All” repository has been starred by over 800 developers.

I am a frequent hackathon participant, as a developer on teams at USC Creating Reality 2018, Microsoft HoloHacks 2016, and the Mira Reality Hackathon 2017.

I am also passionate about collaboration and education, and wrote/taught nonprofit coding curricula to K-12 students in Los Angeles for 4 years. I gave a TED talk about kids teaching kids in the world of programming, and have spoken as a Latino Role Model in the US, Mexico (Puebla, Mérida, Cancún), and Dubai.","Georgia Tech, BS Computer Science (in progress)","Atlanta, GA, USA",@tomthecarrot,Georgia Tech,,unity,vive,unrealEngine,googleVR,oculusRift,vuforia,arCore,webVR,,steamOpenVR,microsoftHololens,cryEngine,,,samsungGearVr,oculusGo,360video,,appleARKit,,,,,,,,

One year ago, I started to look at AR as a medium/tool for creating digital experience around us. After developing in unity with C# and thanks to my 3-year experience of VB competition in high school and one year C++ during my undergrad minor in mathematics, I feel I am actually very comfortable and confident in thinking creatively with immersive technologies especially AR. Architecture design skills allow me to configure and distribute in space both virtually and physically intersecting multiple scales (from furniture to interior to building to city) without any difficulty, while my coding background allows me to learn super fast how to create interactive experience using a new coding language by myself.

Early this year, I participated in the CreatingReality hackathon 2018 in USC. It was my very first hackathon and was one of the most unforgettable experiences in my life. Four people from different background in our team HOX, without anything prepared in advance, collaborated for 3 days and won the grand price of AR in AEC section. This amazing encounter drives me to want to join the Reality Virtually Community. What's more, now, comparing to then, I am confident in myself to contribute more to the team.

Currently, my experience in AR mainly covers a. Multiplayer AR by using Photon/UNet; b. Customize Unity shaders for AR interaction; c.Real-time video streaming etc. I am also developing individually, in collaboration with grad thesis partner Alessio Grancini, on a mixed-reality mobile game ""Games of Deletion""(https://www.z-rz.com/games-of-deletion), and we are planning to develop it further and publish it in the future.","Master of Architecture, Architecture",Los Angeles,@Runze412,kilograph,,unity,,unrealEngine,,,vuforia,arCore,,,steamOpenVR,microsoftHololens,,,,,,360video,,appleARKit,,,,,,,,

A little more about me—in my free time, I volunteer at Code for San Jose where I help make tools to better and empower the community. I also tutor at Read Santa Clara where I help those with low literacy skills to improve their reading, writing, and comprehension. I love mentoring and seeing my students grow. I also love comics, gardening, illustration, and learning new things.

Formation Design Group is an industrial and product design firm that uses VR to help user test and showcase their design work. I create the context surrounding the product, as well as scripting the product's behavior during user interactions.

I started getting into VR in 2015 when I signed up for the Oculus game jam. That one game showed me that this tech was new and it needed content to make it more enjoyable. Later that year I worked on GearVR project where we pushed users in a wheelchair around a circle and in the headset, they were walking through a haunted trail. The idea was to show movement and folks loved it. In 2016, I got into Vive development with 3 projects: Escape the room horror game, flight game that was made at the MIT hackathon and started working on a VR Cat DJ game. While most of these were on the side, I also touched on professional jobs as well that were focused on VR. In 2017/2018, I started learning about AR using ARCore and I’m planning on releasing 2 projects soon.

I truly enjoy the idea of creating something from nothing and I feel like we’re in a time where the tech exist to take folks out of this world and into another.

I am also interested in its’ development in the work industry to communicate information, whether it’s virtual meetings or sketches of buildings.	I hope to contribute to these fields, and currently am aiming to explore any and all fields related to VR/AR to build a toolbox and help develop new technologies.",Currently attending Northeastern University for a BS,Boston,,Northeastern University,https://drive.google.com/a/realityvirtuallyhack.com/file/d/1GPorYbjCGyJgDsYqFTCmgq4_P0--1Dv0/view?usp=drivesdk,unity,vive,,googleVR,oculusRift,,,,,,,,,,samsungGearVr,,360video,,,,,,,,,,

I have a deep passion for Computer Graphics and using motion picture to share stories. In 2016, I had the opportunity to attend the first Creating Reality Hackathon to work on JoyceStick-- an abstract and  immersive adaptation of Joyce's Ulysses. It was at this event that I realized what the ultimate community to me felt like: an open, collaborative (yet competitive!), technical and creative space where nothing was impossible, everyone's opinions were heard and only hard work stood between you and whatever you wanted to create. The resources, the space and most importantly, the people were all a part of something far more significant than the sum of its parts.
Since then, I have grown a lot and now realize how much of an honor it would be to get back to the same environment that was so formative for me at the beginning of my graphics/engineering career. I am currently developing  a series of location-based AR history stories using a cross-platform AR SDK called Teleportal that I helped develop with my close friend and engineering mentor Thomas Suarez.
We are working with an LA-based organization called Tecnolatinx to bring these stories of protest, violence and struggle for Chicano/a Civil Rights back to life in the exact places where they happened. Local historians and researchers are contributing too to help build as accurate and unbiased of a recreation of history as possible. While it will be incredible to give the Latinx (and otherwise!) community of LA the ability to experience the pivotal events of their city's past told via immersive technology, I am most looking forward to the eventual release of a tool to empower anyone to create and share location-based art and story.","Computer Science, Film Studies","Los Angeles, CA",ryreede,Dreamworks Animation Studio,,unity,vive,unrealEngine,googleVR,oculusRift,,arCore,,,steamOpenVR,microsoftHololens,,,vivePro,,,,,appleARKit,,googleTango,,,,,,

Since then, I have played around with a few of these frameworks, such as Unity and Google's ARCore. My previous AR apps were replications of simple games like a Rubik's Cube and Jenga with detailed animations and realistic textures that make them look extremely similar to real-world objects. My goal has not only to think of new applications but make them extremely realistic to provide the best experience. As most of my experience is with ARKit, I am excited to learn more technologies and collaborate with others to create amazing apps. I want to join this community to think of new applications for this new market of AR/VR experiences that can help, entertain, and reshape the way people look at community.

As a graduate from the Media Lab in Helsinki, I have strong fundamentals in Design Thinking.  Everyday I combine this basis with my absolute love of team building to help groups of individuals turn into cohesive, high performing teams that create products customers love.  My perfect day includes a team-wide brainstorm which transitions into a hack-a-thon that ultimately creates a kick-ass experience.

I love games and have loved them since my dad introduced us to D&D when I was 5.   This transitioned into a 10 year ride in the games industry where I was a designer on 3 AR games (Diggs Nightcrawler PS3, 1 PS Vita Game & 1 3DS Game) and then became a Product Manager on GOTY Dragon Age Inquisition and the upcoming Anthem.

Wayfair has brought me a chance to build sticky, forward leaning experiences with world class teams for the mass market B2C and B2B customer.

Why do I want to join the Reality Virtually Community?
Because people are awesome but don’t always know how to turn their awesome ideas into reality.  I want to help them  take all of their ideas and turn them into cohesive, coherent, delightful experiences.  I love working closely on products with well, everyone, and hope as part of this community I hope to have a chance to get my hands back into design whilst helping teams with my extensive experience in games & e-commerce.

Working at a company called Cyrus Biotechnologies I wrote a few key data visualization components, mostly in the 2D data visualization library D3.js. Cyrus's main product provides a CAD interface for protein engineers to design de novo proteins. Like any good CAD software, a large portion of the product was dedicated to the 3D modeling and representation of proteins. I am particularly fascinated with representing data that would traditionally be represented in a 2D space, in three dimensions. For instance, one of the data visualizers I wrote showed what parts of the protein were likely to cause an immune response in humans (this data was called a T-Cell Epitope Scan). The 2D component was useful, but it wasn't until I implemented 3D visualization on the actual model of the protein that the resident scientists got excited. I think representing data in three dimensions is so much more powerful than traditional methods. In addition, as I was just leaving to go to college, Cyrus had begun investigating AR conferencing in which two people from across the globe could be looking at the same protein in a virtual space. Their avatars would be able to point to various parts of the protein and perform all of the same actions as a user who was using the non-VR version of CAD. The difference was that the VR version was far more intuitive. Being able to seamlessly move your head through the protein to zoom in on specific portions offered the user a much more natural experience than fiddling with a mouse. I think the future of VR/AR is in increased productivity across many fields, and I would love to pursue this idea at Reality Virtually.",Computer Science,"Atlanta, GA, WA",mattkelseymk,Georgia Institute of Technology,,unity,,,googleVR,,vuforia,,,,,,,,,,,360video,,,,,,,,,,

At RV2017 I discovered my passion for AR, loved learning about ARKit, met new people and made lasting friendships with diverse fellow hackers.

RV 2017 was my favorite hackathon of all of last year and unfortunately while I wasn’t able to make it to Creating Reality on the west coast, I have been looking forward to the return of RV to the Media Lab ever since I attended.

I earned my BA from Cornell University where I studied Socio-cultural Anthropology, Africana Studies, and Global Health with a collective focus on urban community development. In 2017 I founded Thatmiddlechild Productions, a creative platform to celebrate the lives of  silenced communities and make new media more accessible. Thatmiddlechild Productions authentically commemorates and documents the realities of these communities through personal narrative, textured sound, and portraiture.

The Reality Virtually Community will be the ultimate test of consistent intentionality in storytelling that I strive for and it is exciting to be part of a team that can hold me accountable While XR can be entertainment, it also has the power to instruct and lead its audience through revelation of authentic experiences. Participating in the Hackathon will give me the unparalleled experience of collaborating with varied individuals in different specialties that will take my storytelling to the next level. Through teamwork, sharing ideas without fear of consequences, and asking the hard questions the biggest discoveries can be made and the most wonderful and intentional story can be told. As a storyteller it is my role to be action oriented and provide the guide of how an idea becomes tangible. The Hackathon allows me the opportunity to learn more about idea generation, managing a project, utilizing tools, and how to present a project on stage, all which are integral to a career in New Media. I’m excited to share ideas, learn from others, and build a network that I can continue to collaborate with on future projects.","Bachelor of Arts, Anthropology, Cornell University","Los Angeles, CA, USA",,Thatmiddlechild Productions,,unity,,,googleVR,,,,webVR,,,,,,,,oculusGo,360video,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this project is to build a platform that can make psychological testing easier and safer.
I firmly believe psychological testing on a VR is the way to go. VR equipment can provide an immersive environment resemble a real-world situation, which opens up more opportunities in psychological testing.

Data collection would be easier in a virtual world. Testing method can break the boundary of reality, researchers can make things appear in the thin air and see how people react to it, the only constraint on what could happen in an experiment is imagination. An experiment will be safer and easier to replicate, all you need is a room and some VR equipment and you can replicate the experiment on the other side of the world.

I have a deep interest in video games and a strong computer science and software development background. And I’m also interested in making AR game/ applications. Since the processing power of the cell phone can already support AR, I think there is are a lot of possibilities we can explore with the commercial level application.

My hometown is Mexico City and was raised in Los Angeles. My experience as an immigrant in this country has been of learning to make the most of every opportunity. Studying immersive technology and participating in hackathons has allowed me to create a voice for people who believe in a better world and seek opportunity.

In 2017 I helped create an app to help people advocate for themselves through simulated environments in VR. To give users proxemic and verbal performance feedback we integrated interactive 3D hands and interfaces using a leap motion sensor into 360º videos to put you in scenarios like a full MIT Lecture hall, an interview setting, or any situation where you may need to speak effectively. In 2018 I was accepted to the Oculus Launchpad Program where I created my first narrative VR piece called, 'Realidad Tropical' based on a series of short stories from Mexico City.

In May of 2017 I was hired by the World Bank to travel to Tegucigalpa, Honduras to give a workshop and keynote talk on immersive technology. There I was able to share this knowledge and inspire Honduran people to use photogrammetry and 3D modeling techniques in order to create breakthrough new startups.

I believe in this technology because it allows us an opportunity to create new worlds, and simulate realities in order for us to develop a greater connection with who we are and where we wish to go. Being the first of my family to get a college education in this country, it is with much gusto and hope that I approach my craft so that I can not only create the impact I wish to see in the world, but empower others to do so as well.

I also investigated a murder scene in an apartment using tools such as an UV flashlight and a gunshot residue detection kit. As I ventured through these thrilling scenes, I was physically present in an office building in North Carolina and wearing a virtual reality headset. I had fun in the incredibly immersive adventures I embarked on, but I more importantly recognized my life’s calling to work with VR to help humanity.

I did my senior year capstone internship at CrossComm, an award-winning mobile, web, and immersive app studio in Durham. In addition to exploring Iraq and a crime scene, I spearheaded several personal projects. I developed my own virtual reality environment in Unity, begun learning HTML and C#, and received great mentorship from a VR developer.

One day of my internship, I spent two hours in VR interviewing and flying around a park with CrossComm’s VR developer, Mike, who was in Louisiana. We could see each other’s facial expressions as if talking in real life, and I was more engaged than during a 2D video call. Mike explained to me that his relationship with his dad, who lives across the country, has greatly improved because of their time playing chess and talking through VR.

My capstone work confirmed that I desire to help humanity by designing impactful VR experiences. The good that VR could do, from safe traversal of far places to strengthening human relationships, is an important challenge that I want to tackle. As I pursue my engineering degree, I desire to surround myself with other passionate people who want to solve vital world problems with VR technology.","Franklin W.

Together we have made some interesting things, each year for a different kind of equipment. This year we are creating an AR cat collecting game that we hope to finish by January 2019. I have several ideas for projects next year. Since we’ve done a project for the GearVR, Vive, Cardboard, and Mobile AR, I’d like to explore the ideas of the VR CAVE and interactive environments. Using a Kinect, I would like to experiment with creating the experience of a window looking into another world, a single window with an interactive vignette, or perhaps a world that surrounds a player through multiple screens in a space, similar to a VR CAVE.

My main area of research is screen-based MR. I found screens to be very useful and handy for interventions designed for marginalized populations, especially for children with Autism, and older adults. Moreover, I have lost my left eye's vision when I was very young, so it is very challenging for me to use VR headsets as I do not have the stereo-vision which is the main part of interactive VR headsets. As a researcher in this realm, however, I would love to move forward in proposing new VR solutions for individuals with visual impairments. I would love to turn my disability to an opportunity to help other individuals with no stereo-vision having a better experience in VR. To achieve this goal, I would love to be part of the Reality Virtually Community, as I cannot accomplish this aim without the support from Reality Virtually community.
For me as a female scholar in the field, there were many hurdles and obstacles to learning MR, and I think the main reason was not belonging to a supportive community. I had to learn it all by my self, in isolation, which was very tough. That's the other reason for me to join the community.
Moreover, I have never got this unique opportunity to attend the Hackathon in previous years, but I would love to do it as a young faculty.

I am a game developer enjoying development culture. Immersive Technology is the field that I am pursuing improving gameplay experience.
When I was in high school, I have watched two animations: Accel World & Sword Art Online. They successfully depict the imagination of the future world which heavily relies on MR (VR, AR) technologies. The animations confirm me that even if today’s technology doesn’t meet the requirement to achieve such interactions, they are the future.
In my junior year, VR technology started to show its strength. I tried HTC VIVE at that time and the excitement and surprise it brought to me were extremely unforgettable. I realized maybe that future didn’t seem far away, it was coming.
Therefore, I took 2 classes: Introduction to Virtual Reality & Virtual Reality and got A in both courses. I have experienced Google Cardboard and leaned VR histories from various odd devices and applications. I also built a simple agent login android app using Vuforia. You could scan the logo of game Watch Dog, and it would show a cool agent confirm scene. I have also made a simple Leap Motion application to experience another interactive method in the VR world.
I was so impressed by VR that I choose it as my graduation project. Due to the existing technology constraints, today’s VR game is not suitable for long-time playing. Considering this point, I finally decided to develop a game focusing more on interactive experience in a limited time range: unleash the magic by drawing charms. I achieved real-time online handwriting recognition in this project and obtained VR development experience in 2 game engines because I shipped my project made by Unity to Unreal after I found the better rendering effect in Unreal Engine.",National Dong Hwa University ( Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering ) ,"Boston, MA, United States",,Northeastern University,,unity,vive,unrealEngine,googleVR,oculusRift,vuforia,,,,steamOpenVR,,,,,,,,,,,,student,Chinese,,A group I belong to,,

With this experience on VR development, I am determined to get deeper into the Virtual reality World, “the oasis”(quote from ready player one). Therefore, I get back to my graduate school and dive into learning the whole story of the virtual reality including computing system design, circuits analysis, and optimization, haptics research and advanced computer graphics. Now, I am desperate and hungry to find more brilliant use cases of virtual reality like the players in the movie “Ready player one” finding “easter eggs” and make those be parts of my drive for engineering the future of computing and learning. That’s why I want to jump into this hackathon, mingling, surviving and creating.

Immersive technology is a great tool to solve problems in the world. For example, my grandmother suffered for 6 years with Alzheimer's disease. At the start of when she became ill, my family did major construction on my house. I noticed that whenever my grandmother was in my new house, she felt confused and her memory was worse, but when she was in her house, her memory was much better. After doing some research on Alzheimer's, I found that memories are easier to retrieve when one is comfortable and in a familiar environment. Since my new house was not familiar to my grandmother, she was unable to access her memories as well as in her home. In addition, I discovered that a being in a place where a certain memory occurred could bring back that specific memory. If my grandmother were still alive, I would create a VR experience that could help her retrieve some memories. In Unity I would build/recreate some places where we spent time together and insert real photos and videos we have of the memory into those places I recreate, associating the memory and the place together for her to see and hopefully remember.

I would love the opportunity to use immersive technologies such as VR and AR to help those in need and provide them with a tool that can really change their lives.

However, so much of real life happens beyond the edges of our screens, and I’ve long been interested in the experiences that spill over those boundaries.

While studying Human Computer Interaction at UCSD, I began to focus on how humans solved problems and accomplished tasks using not only their own minds, but their bodies, their environments, and whatever tools and information they had available. I also started to get excited about emerging technologies and the possibilities they had for providing us with better tools that are seamlessly integrated with our environments. I knew immediately I wanted to help shape these possibilities.

It’s been especially thrilling to see extended reality technologies become more and more commonplace. Right now is an exciting time to start thinking about the possibilities these technologies have for solving real-world problems, and as a designer I can’t think of many challenges I’d rather be working on.

To prepare myself for designing XR work I have been learning as much as I can online and am currently taking a class on designing for virtual and augmented reality. I’ve also been spending time in virtual reality at home paying attention to both the good and bad methods different experiences have for interacting with virtual worlds. Additionally, I’ve been learning Unity and some 3D modeling to expand my toolkit for prototyping ideas. However, I know that I have a lot to learn, and that nothing beats hands-on experience. So I hope that by joining the Reality Virtually community I can learn from and collaborate with likeminded people who are passionate about creating XR experiences that solve real problems.

Increasingly, our world’s categorical boundaries blur and definitions intertwine - XR for example. Particularly, I believe strongly in the “stories” that exist in our environments, objects, and navigation of space, the stories that anchor us to reality and form our actions and our identity, that we do not always see are there.

This interest in influence-by-abstraction set a course for a seemingly disparate set of passions: mixed reality, filmmaking and urban planning. But old cities whisper novels. Great films edibly challenge our perspectives. With XR/MR, we can integrate and refine these lasting images and narratives into everyday walks down our burgeoning city streets.

With extensive background in film production, I am diversifying skills in mixed and extended reality. Programming since youth summer camps at Stanford, I am currently pursuing Informatics degree, leveraging UCI’s large game development community, as well as pursuing research at UCIUS, one of the two Urban Planning schools in the UC system. Afterwards there is the growing location-based mixed reality industry springing up around LA (The Void, Spaces, Universal, FoxNext).

Pursuing the Reality Virtuality community, was cemented in my time developing at the Transformative Play Lab, UCI’s experimental XR narrative experience development lab. In the project, a user dons physical NFC cloaks, and IR spellbooks around a smoking cauldron, wired to a Unity, Kinect, and Arduino backend. On. Booming narration, studio light racks, and smoke machines shifted to very willing user interactions. These immersive interfaces of seamless transportation, highly abstracted from it’s cogs, and subsequent sense of “magic” compelling users to act within its highly consistent logical framework, is what I hope to apply to Reality Virtually.","San Jose State University, Mechatronics Engineering.

In the recent project, I organized and developed an exhibition, named Realities. This exhibition invites eight artists using different media in their practices, such as painting, sculpture, video, and sound art, for collaboration to explore the multiplicities of reality we face nowadays. This project also experiments with the potentialities of bridging between the mindset of using traditional media and virtual reality in art making. Without a physical presence, audiences can go to our website and download the VR exhibition for free and explore the pieces through HTC Vive.
Other than developing this VR art gallery, I am also an independent artist and use VR in my practice. My pieces have been exhibited in Cardinal Space (Baltimore), Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Vox Populi (Philadelphia), CICA Museum (South Korea), and many more.

I believe that the blend between the two can create immersion that is unprecedented within either one of the two areas.

Since then, I have worked to develop this interest into my own research project in the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington, such that I can do this for my dissertation. Despite having minimal previous immersive technology/game development experience, my work is going smoothly and, in collaboration with a senior capstone project team at the UW Reality Lab, we are on track to deploy a VR electromagnetism laboratory next quarter for first-year honors students, as a pilot program developing the groundwork to bring VR learning environments to all 1000+ students in the UW introductory electromagnetism course each year.

My interest in participating in the Reality Virtually Hackathon stems from a fantastic experience at my first hackathon, the 2018 Seattle VR/AR Hackathon in September. I feel that I learned more in that 48-hour period, surrounded by brilliant, inspiring, energetic people, than I did in the two months of solo work prior. Without it, my project would be nowhere near the state it is now.

I'd like to join the Reality Virtually Community because I'm passionate about VR, AR and MR tech but do not have an in depth knowledge of each, and I'd love to be able to meet other people who work in this field and learn from their experiences.

I feel strongly that VR/AR will continue to grow and become a prominent figure in entertainment, design, industry, and education.

I am excited for this future, and I am also excited by the way it is essentially a culmination of all my favorite things. In high school, I came to class an hour and a half early almost every day so I could read OpenGL tutorials. I loved that I could make colorful, interactive demos, and I loved that it seemed every aspect involved some clever use of mathematics to emulate our world. I also have decent experience in using Blender 3D to create 3D models.

I really don't have the credentials that some others might, but I am quite passionate about VR. I'm a decent programmer, I know a bit about computer graphics, and I'm passable with linear algebra and concepts like quaternions. I won't bother uploading my resume, as the only relevant info is that I did an internship in full stack web development this summer.

Also, if there are any other ways I can get involved in VR here at MIT, or anyone you know I could talk to, please let me know! I've decided recently that I want to seriously pursue this route and explore what opportunities are available to me.

It actually wasn't until I was in the MIT Media Lab last year, and I was surrounded with about 500 individuals who were bustling and booming with ideas and applications about the AR/VR medium.
Initially having experience only with my local university's VR club (GatorVR), My vision and perspective was narrowed towards exploring ways to build my resume at the least, but the Reality Virtually Community had so much contagious passion that I forced my perspective to widen, and to learn and take in all these perspectives that people all over the world had to offer. It was at the very least, ""mind-opening.""
Now as the the Lead Designer and Graphic Designer for GatorVR, I am looking to push the boundaries myself not only through design, development, and applications, but also being a part of the infectious passion that drives the community to keep expanding their perspectives. With a unique heart stemming from game development, classical music, tinkering electronics and a skillset loosely defined as ""hybrid"" between designers and developers, I will continue to learn more perspectives while also sharing some of my own towards the newer members of the Reality Virtually Community, hoping they will also blast off as I did.",Computer Engineering,"Gainesville, Florida/Alachua, United States",,University of Florida,,unity,vive,unrealEngine,googleVR,oculusRift,vuforia,arCore,webVR,,steamOpenVR,microsoftHololens,,,vivePro,,oculusGo,,,,,,,,,,,

Also I created a 360 video virtual tour  for Alibaba Cloud when I was an intern in Alibaba in this summer. I am currently developing an AR installation experience called Moment and a motion capture live performance (performance will be on December) with other three ITP and IDM students. Moment is using ARkit and motion capture (Motive), it is about a story how two strangers meet with each other and fall in love with each other in New York City . By following with these two store lines, our users’ paths will also  come cross together.

The community emphasizes diversity and working with new people, and with my incredibly diverse team that spanned multiple continents, gender identities, sexual orientations and work/school backgrounds, we were able to execute a project we were really proud of, which was a twist on the future envisioned by Vernor Vinge in his book Rainbows End.

To also hack at the MIT Media Lab was also an incredible experience that opened my mind to more creativity and sophistication in the technology space beyond the ideas I walked in the door with. I am obsessed with the navigation of space and how the environments we exist in tell stories and inform our decisions about how we interact with those spaces and the people inside of them.

Where I stand right now in regards to immersive technologies is as someone who wants to integrate the body as wholly as possible into our experiences. I enjoy working with hardware and designing physical objects that can then be integrated into virtual or augmented/mixed experiences, and in the past this has been explored through VR installations, both solo exhibitions and installations worked on by teams. Even at the Creating Reality hackathon, my team and I went to Home Depot and got a bunch of physical materials to build a physical installation to augment our VR experience about going through a Rene Magritte-inspired door.

As a developer and artist, my passion is sharing new ideas with people different than myself, because the more I share myself and my ideas, and the more I hear and understand other people and their ideas, the better all our experiences will be in the future.

What make my heart sings are tinkering with immersive technologies and using such technologies to improve the natural human-robot interaction. As more robots are deployed in factories and search-and-rescue operations, the need for them to be both taskable and collaborative increase. An earlier experimental project at MIRROR Lab has shown that allocentric gestures, in which robots circle their targets in users' fields of view when the users wear the Microsoft HoloLens, to be an effective communication strategy, both in terms of objective accuracy and subjective perception, especially when paired with complex natural language references. While contributing, reading various research papers, and learning at the MIRROR Lab, I've envisioned a nearby future where robots, integrated with immersive technologies, can communicate with their human users and teammates in a way that will be effective and natural, while minimizing the need for special training. In addition to research, I greatly enjoy tinkering around with various VR/AR/MR headsets and working on spontaneous ideas with friends. My friend and I recently self-learned and developed an AR-enabled Android app for a K-12 interactive outreach event. Playing with our app, children could look through the phone camera lens and see digital content overlaid onto physical storybooks. Working on these projects made me realize the many potentials of immersive technologies and increased my interest in collaborating with other AR/VR/MR enthusiasts. Not long ago, I heard about the Reality Virtually Hackathon and loved reading about the awesome applications developed in the past events. With the opportunity to attend the Reality Virtually Hackathon 2019, I hope to brainstorm and get hands-on with a diverse group of participants as well as turn our ideas with immersive tech into reality.",Computer Science,"Denver, Colorado",megatran23,Colorado School of Mines,,unity,,,googleVR,,vuforia,,webVR,,,microsoftHololens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting with the days of attending tech socials focused on the rise of VR technology, I soon realized that there were many people interested in applying it, but not enough who truly understand the technology itself from the ground up to develop the next big game-changer. I strive to keep up with the latest technological advances and understand the drivers for innovation from a variety of perspectives, from the myriad of applications (such as surgical guidance tools, augmented learning methods, and technologies for safer transportation) to the design and development of even more advanced holographic technologies. Since then, a partner (another applicant) and I grew a design out of a small, personal side project for the development of a novel, holographic heads-up display (HUD) for vehicles (patent pending). My role as the systems engineer helped to develop and hone his prodigious idea based on my own system engineering experience, as well as manage the design process. This has honestly been the most motivating and exciting experience in my career thus far because I see so much potential to apply AR in our daily lives. Our project has had a few setbacks in recent weeks due to unforeseen circumstances. However, we are looking to continue with progress soon. Regardless of the outcome, I have never been more motivated and am invested in directing my career toward the development and management of AR/VR technologies. And as a woman of color in STEM, I feel it is important to increase our visibility in these technological focus areas to play an integral role in the development, direction, and evolution of this technology.","University of New Mexico - M.S.

Toro Vega and I currently course the 11th grade in the Dr. Carlos González High School in Aguada, Puerto Rico. I’ve always had a passion for technology in general. Being in my school’s tech club, I’m involved in various projects, including ¡Quiero Almorzar!, a web app that provides quick and easy access to the school’s lunchroom menu and daily registry, based on the ASP.NET Model View Controller Framework; and SiMonAHE, an automation and monitoring system built for our school garden, which is based on Arduino and the ESP8266 chip for internet connectivity. On the past May, I participated at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, with my project: Ultrasonic Glasses for the Visually Impaired. I gained a lot of Arduino programming knowledge thanks to that project.

Recently I participated in a Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality Boot Camp, hosted by the Puerto Rico Science, Technology & Research Trust, in the basic camp and also got chosen to participate in the advanced one. In those two weeks, they gave us an intense course which introduced us into the world of virtual and augmented reality. We worked on various projects on different programs, including Unreal Engine 4, Google SketchUp, Google Blocks, Snapchat Lens Studio, and other VR/AR apps. We developed a project that simulated how a settlement in Mars would look like and it’s components. This was developed using Unreal Engine 4, and was demonstrated using Lenovo Explorer Headsets. We also worked on a city of the future, developed in CoSpaces and demonstrated with the Lenovo Explorer Headset. I was amazed after learning all the different applications Virtual Reality has not only on the recreational aspect, but also in the architectural and engineering fields.

These are the interests which influenced me towards the world of AR/VR. I first started my journey by getting acquainted with Unity3D and developing games like PacMan and Araknoid. I then entered Georgia Tech as a Master’s student concentrating in the area of AR/VR. I first worked on creating an AR Pit using Oculus and OVR Vision Pro. Subsequently, I worked on a bigger project which involved designing and developing a training simulation using HoloLens for nurses to learn to clean up after Ebola patients. I was also involved in another AR application which uses the concept of exposure therapy to allow users to acclimate to spiders. We used ARCore and Unity3D for development. The spiders performed a random walk in the environment and we had a portal which leads the user into a VR world of spiders. Currently, I am interning with Stanley Black and Decker where I am working on creating an AR remote assistance application using Native android and ARCore. I have also replaced the HoloLens tracking with the VIVE trackers to provide more accuracy for applications. Recently, we also bought a Magic Leap and I worked on creating a Halloween application which has pumpkins popping up on the horizontal planes and ghosts trying to attack the user. Apart from these applications, I have worked with mini AR experiences which involved the use of Vuforia markers. I also attended AWE 2018 to learn more about XR.

However, through power of the Internet I came to know the fascinating applications of VR and AR, including but not limited to surgical training and practice (e.g. mirracle), athletic/military training, computer-augmented cognitive behavioural therapy for morbidities like PTSD, entertainment, and telecommunications.
These immersive technologies may soon permeate many walks of life for the purposes of 3D/4D “prototyping” or delivering an end-user experience in a convenient yet economic fashion. Initiatives such as the Stanford Virtual Heart Project have already made their way into medical practice and curricula, but I believe this technology may be employed by developmental biologists in sharing their research data– by which they could capture how cells congregate to form tissues, interact through biochemical signals to become an organ in three dimensional space, and share such visual data to the rest of the scientific community in VR or AR ‘file format’ rather than a 2D fine print on a journal paper or 3D schematic on a 2D-webpage.

As such, I believe my background in molecular biology and cardiovascular sciences will bring forward interesting ideas to my team.

My undergraduate degree in Sustainable Product Design helped me to develop my skills in both physical and digital three-dimensional design. I recently completed a User Experience Design program at General Assembly, where I expanded my knowledge and experience in prototyping, user research, and testing. During my time at General Assembly, I realized that working with augmented reality and virtual reality is a perfect fit for my combination of skills.

My understanding of both physical and digital 3D designs helps me to understand ways of seamlessly integrating AR objects and interfaces into an environment. My recent work in interface design and user experience design helps me to understand ways of creating 2D-to-3D ""layered reality"" interfaces that bridge the gap between dimensions for users.

I believe that augmented reality and virtual reality interfaces will be how we interact with most of our devices in the future.  To this end, I have recently started volunteering my time as a designer for ArtLanguageCode.org, a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to democratizing interactive design. ArtLanguageCode's Alchemy language makes it easy for anyone to create interactive 2D media presentations, and their most recent work extends this ease-of-creation into the 3D world via panoramas. My work with them entails designing the interfaces that will help new creators to understand how to map 2D interfaces on to 3D worlds and that will help users of products created with Alchemy to more easily orient themselves to 3D spaces.","General Assembly, User Exeperience Design Immersive, Certification 2018.

The digital reality space has been on my mind for the past 1.5 years but it was only recently that I decided to double down into it. As a result, I have stopped all full-time recruiting and am spending most of my waking hours learning as much as possible about the space.

I’m particularly interested in the UX of AR/MR but have also recently been thinking about the relationship between the individual and the city.

The idea of hyper-personalization within the city is a interesting bedfellow to AR, from both a business standpoint with highly-targeted ads to a more humanistic standpoint with location-dependent resurfacing of personal memories.  From an accessibility standpoint, the city’s navigational elements can be redefined digitally to empower users with a disability to interact with the world with the same level of autonomy as their peers. Also, with the ability to digitally create structures within the city, context-dependent structures such as phone booths and information kiosks can be replaced with other socially-valuable features in decline such as green space.

I've been the proponent of virtual reality and augmented reality in our office, I've experimented and implemented as much as possible.

Ever since last years hackathon, I've been churning about immersive technology that fits seamlessly into how we work and think as designers - collaboration is key! I'm hopeful that this year I will find a team of people interested in creating such a tool.

The magic of taking scenes I made in three.js many years ago for desktop viewing and putting them into an immersive environment with little effort never gets old, and seeing the rise of software like Sketchfab and Google Poly that integrate the power and accessibility of the web with a stunning visual medium is no doubt the way forward.

Science journalists wrangle complexity to provide clear, engaging translation of science and its potential benefits and risks. We spend careers developing the ability to navigate endless jargon, complex brilliance, arcane institutions, and technical complications to communicate a clearer picture of our universe and all who inhabit it. And we do this while building the mental reflexes and poise to call bullshit, even on Nobel prize winners, if needed.

This skill set is vital to the craft, but most science journalism is accomplished in the ""tell"" and the ""show."" My field hasn’t been focused on the ""make.""

Here at MIT, as a research fellow, I’m trying to evolve a new approach to science storytelling by building immersive VR and AR experiences that will help me bring the engineering mentality back the newsroom.

Journalism needs more makers. The alternative is depressing. Leave tech companies to completely own VR/AR and the experiences will mostly be about entertainment and buying things, not about understanding ourselves and the world around us.

Joining the Reality Virtually Community would help me become a champion for new immersive approaches in journalism.

During the hackathon, I would like to assemble a team to build an AR app focused on the projection of internal human anatomy onto the body, so that the viewer can better understand what makes them tick. A ""Well-fie"" in other words. In the future, this app could be scaled to connect to genetic risk profile data. I am still in the early stages of collecting the full team for the effort.

My background is advertising, but with the decision to go back to school and study IDM, I've learned a lot about AR and VR and am really excited about it's potential.

Ar/vr/mr is the next frontier as far as interfaces go. Right now there are a lot of constraints and a large cost barrier to entry, but as those constraints loosen and costs come down, there will be a massive demand for people who know how to design and develop meaningful interactions in the space. I want to make sure that I am ready for that day. Beyond that, it is really cool to be part of a community that is pushing the envelope and exploring the applications of this technology.

I have had the opportunity to work on a couple AR applications. I’ve used AFrame to develop a meditation guide for people who struggle with anxiety, and I’m currently working with Unity with ARKit 2 to build a collaborative tilt brush for artists. For another class project, a classmate and I created an app with Vuforia that allowed sneakerheads to customize their sneakers in Augmented Reality.

I'm really looking forward to meeting like-minded designers and developers at MIT, and think that this will be an incredible opportunity to push the industry forward, and re-imagine what is possible in AR/VR/MR.

I’ve been creating interactive experiences that combine science visualization and emerging technologies such as AR, VR, and MR to leverage data generated by scientists and enable museum visitors to interact with scientific data visualization across multiple media platforms. I’ve developed a series of AR and VR experiences that add digital layers of current research about our natural world to static exhibits incorporating visual content based on observed data, computational models and simulations, CT scans of specimens, and panoramic images from science missions.

As a technologist who has a background in architecture, I’m interested in augmenting the physical environment in a creative way and have been looking for opportunities to collaborate with people who work at the intersection of art, architecture, computer science and interactive technology. As my work for the museum proposes new dynamic ways of engaging with museum exhibits, I would like to explore unexpected ways to interact with the physical environment in our daily lives and to help us perceive the world in different ways. For instance, you look at a tree branch moving in the wind through your phone’s screen and get closer to it, it has transformed into an animal in AR experience, like the way you imagined. I believe joining the Reality Virtually Community and this upcoming hackathon will give me the opportunity to expand on these ideas.

I first started going to hackathons two years ago where I started off solo, making a Tower Defense game. After that year, I started to delve into Python where I wanted to reach new heights. Using multiple modules, my partner and I developed a Multiplayer Battle Royale Shooter game. It was a very big eye opener for me to start delving not only into simply games, but into bigger and greater things. Thus, I decided to program in C# - specifically, Unity. I've done a few 3D projects in the past, but never a project that involved VR. To me, VR seemed like a challenge I could never overcome, and yet I still wanted to reach it because of the potential it contained. With my group members Noor Nasri, Anish Aggarwal and David Hui, we managed to make our own VR house modelling application with Unity, Oculus Rift, and many other API's. It was our first VR application that wasn't a game. That's when I realized that if I use VR, I can turn anything I want into reality, as long as I have the mindset to change my thoughts into action. After realizing the potential of VR and its applications, the biggest reason why I want to join the Virtual Reality community is because I want to eventually create an application where someone can be fully immersed in VR. More specifically, an application that provides a greater meaning. Currently, there are many applications in VR for gaming, but what I want to do is create an application that can leave a mark on society. After all, a VR application can impact many people in many positive ways, for the limits are endless.

From SAO to Ready Player One, reading stories about a world of dreams in which superpowers exist was a fun hobby for me. The idea of making my own world, like a castle in the clouds, was a dream that I thought would always stay a dream. However, four months ago, I realized that my dreams do not have to just stay dreams. Together, a group of friends and I started going to hackathons and making Virtual Reality Hacks. For example, at GrizzHacks, we made a Virtual Reality car driving simulator. Our team's most recent project was a Virtual Reality House Modeling System that uses voice recognition to place furniture around a house.

I was introduced to it by a friend who's very passionate about it. I'm part of a multidisciplinary undergraduate program called Vertically Integrated Projects, and I'm on the VR team. This semester we're creating a game, though I can't say that games are where my primary interest in VR lies.

I envision VR as an educational tool. I am double majoring in math and computer science, and one of the ways I've considered pursuing both of these things as a career is by making educational programs inspired by youtube channels like 3Blue1Brown and Numberphile. I think VR would be a fantastic tool for something like that.

Take, for example, the essence of linear algebra series by 3Blue1Brown, linked here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
Imagine interacting with these animations in VR. Or this video on quaternions, also by 3Blue1Brown: https://youtu.be/d4EgbgTm0Bg
Playing around with the stereographic projection of a quaternion in an immersive, 3D environment would be a phenomenal learning experience. I love math, and I want to share that passion with others. I think being able to give a visual intuition for math concepts to students is a good way of sparking interest and passion in the subject. My dream is to create a VR app that allows you to interact with abstract mathematical objects such as graphs, surfaces, vectors and vector spaces, knots, etc. and give students the tools they need to develop their own insights and intuitions about mathematical concepts.

The hackathons I have participated in the past years at MIT, USC and The New School in NY started many new projects, helped to grow many networks and led to many still ongoing collaborations. They offered an opportunity for all of us to learn, communicate our interests and realize new - formerly almost unthinkable - ideas. At the “Reality Virtually Hackathon 2017” for instance, we established a hard-working team with members from many continents on the first day. Then we created a multiplayer game-like educational VR experience on biology and health. We even attempted to integrate biofeedback. The hackathon offered not only inspirations but lasting friendships and cooperations.
The hackathons have for instance led to a cross-disciplinary AR breath biofeedback project with Wim “The Iceman” Hof who is a mindfulness pioneer in the field of wellbeing.
Since 2015, I have initiated multiple AR/VR projects, and collaborated with developers, artists, musicians, neuroscience researchers, environmental scientists and activists. The project ""mYndful"" from 2014-2016 was created at The Institute of Neuroscience at The University of Oregon, and focuses on guided meditation in VR using heart rate biofeedback. It was published and presented at Stanford University, Harvard University, Ruben Museum of Art among others.
Another VR breath biofeedback project was created in conjunction with The University of Miami and Miami-Dade County, and centered around ocean advocacy using the immersive environment.

I do not know who said that, but that sure has been the most defining ideology for most parts of my life. The thrill in finding a new challenge, the excitement in solving it and the gratifying feeling on completion, all of which make me seek out in search of new adventures.
This has led me into trying a variety of things, including programming, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, business consultancy (end-to-end: ideation to business plan development to growth estimates), writing, traveling. For the most parts, these were not just simply interests, but involved focused learning & rigorous practice culminating in a considerable amount of success (ranging from cash prizes to sponsored trips). This can be mainly attributed to the fact that I only do what I love and most of all, love what I do. And what's more, I can effectively communicate my views, comfortable in working with, presenting to, and negotiating with peers, senior management and customers.

One of my projects is visualizing Science and Health News in AR, in which I used ARKit to build an APP that can provide a more immersive way to tell stories and bring more intuitive interactions. To join the Reality Virtually Community is a great chance for me to meet with different people in this area. It can be very helpful to the project which I am working on currently. I think I can share my experience with others and bring my strength at user experience design thinking to the event.","New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, ITP, MS","New York City, NY, US",,New York University,https://drive.google.com/a/realityvirtuallyhack.com/file/d/1RUBXpBxPaEGCmbS39fqmwX8NekpohSzD/view?usp=drivesdk,unity,vive,unrealEngine,,oculusRift,vuforia,,,,steamOpenVR,microsoftHololens,,sonyPlaystationVR,vivePro,samsungGearVr,oculusGo,,,appleARKit,,,student,Asian,,A group I belong to,,

Of the research being conducted, I am especially interested in learning about efforts towards using innovative technologies to augment the central nervous system. For example, I am fascinated by research at our institute focused on using Virtual Reality (VR) avatars for stroke gait recovery, exposure therapy, and the use of VR for post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.  As a result, two years ago I established the Lumeum Project, with the goal of bringing VR to seniors living in assisted and independent living communities. I used human centered design techniques to embed myself in senior communities to better inform the creation of a User Interface. Unsurprisingly, seniors love the content and use it to reminisce on past adventures. Using Unity I created a touch screen interfaces with a 360 video player behind, adjusted it to match interactions more common with geriatric populations and am on my way to finishing to an interface that can be safely self-administered. Furthermore, during this process, a resident in one of the communities liked VR so much that she invited her son to participate. The family was so enthusiastic that I brought a prototyping 360 camera to her son’s home and filmed his well wishes. Upon returning the content to his community bound mother, she loved it and the idea of a virtual family visit. I believe in the power of VR and presence. We are only reaching the beginning of the technology and I would love to contribute however I can in creating something beautiful with the Media Lab. ","BA, Psychology, University of San Francisco.

At my former company, Night & Day Studios, I worked on over 60 children’s mobile apps that have been played 100 million times worldwide. As the power of handheld devices has increased and the app market has matured, I’ve done more and more work in XR. I want to push the boundaries of what’s possible and participate in the development of new design patterns.

When I started my position at Night & Day Studios in early 2011, the kids category on the App Store had yet to be created. My colleagues and I helped to define the category through a series of successes and failures, establishing digital style guides, extending brands and business models, and developing best practices in mobile design for kids. XR experiences are now in a similar phase where designers, strategists, researchers, and developers are defining the patterns and best practices of the future.

Last March, on a quest to find new inspiration, I attended SXSW. Skip Rizzo from the Institute for Creative Technologies gave an amazing talk on therapeutic and experimental uses of VR. Deeply moved, I founded my new company, Lightseed Inc., to design XR games and experiences that build empathy, motivate, inspire, and heal. I’m particularly interested in the digital therapeutics space.

In 2009 I shattered my tibial plateau in a trampoline accident. Ever since I’ve suffered from chronic pain and limited mobility. I am thoroughly invested in how digital therapeutics can help people, particularly children, who are vulnerable to the negative side-effects of traditional pain management medications.","Loyola Marymount University, BA Studio Arts (Graphic Design Emphasis); Art Institute of Portland, BS Web and Interactive Media Design; Udacity, Nanodegree VR Developer (in progress)","Portland, OR, USA",Brianne_Baker,Lightseed Inc.,https://drive.google.com/a/realityvirtuallyhack.com/file/d/1rF_Ut9-1RVojAVqKU0eCjOwpZH5hl_Cj/view?usp=drivesdk,unity,vive,,googleVR,,,,,,steamOpenVR,,,,,,oculusGo,,,,,,,White,,A group I belong to,,

Since starting my masters in Digital+Media at the Rhode Island School of Design, I have been particularly interested in questions relating to how technologies shape our behaviors. My thesis—in the form of a theatrical play performed by participants reading either as a human or as a chatbot that I programmed—explored the extent to which we can empathize with a digital simulation of human interaction, mirroring interactions that we have with smart homes and other AIs. The emotional response of the audience illustrated how immersive our technologies already are and how the lines between digital and physical are blurring. What I want to know is, how do we push those boundaries even more and how can we enhance our experiences even further?

Now transitioning into design as an Experience Designer, I continue to explore the relationships between the human and the digital but have shifted towards solving for those interactions and asking how to utilize technology as a tool to leverage existing behaviors and create experiences that engage users. Some projects I’ve worked on, merging mobile and retail experiences, further challenged me to design novel interfaces that engineered new user behaviors.

What excites me most about a lot of immersive technologies, such as AR, is how they can further complement our biological senses with our new-found digital senses, enhancing our interactions with ourselves, with the physical spaces and with those around us. I am most curious about the conversations that these two realities can have and how they can further augment us, making us more human than human.","Rhode Island School of Design, MFA in Digital + Media; Western University, BFA in Honors Specialization in Studio Arts","Boston, MA, USA",,"Digitas, Publicis Groupe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My job requires me to be constantly learning as new technologies and small innovations are being made every few months. My day job, as well as my interest in VR, has forced me to stay on the bleeding edge of technology. I have attended GDC the past two years as well as keep in touch with industry professionals as I continue to learn, explore, and create. I want to take all that I have learned and make something truly great in the VR space.
During the day I work as part of Schneider Electric’s Innovation lab, developing new software and wowing clients with our experiments. At night I’m both studying virtual reality and developing a vr game, as part of a startup called Virtuo Studios. The startup began with a demo created at this hackathon in 2017; I met one of the participants and went into business with her. I currently reside as the company’s CTO. We are trying to create an innovative, hands-free experience where a player can conduct an orchestra. The best experiences in the VR world feel natural and intuitive, and often forgo the need to press any buttons at all. Why hold down two buttons (that you can’t see) to pick up an object when you can just use your hand? That is the principle of innovation: always being on the lookout for new and better ways to do things. This drives my life, and my career.
I’ve also seen the power this technology has and what the future holds for simulations, as well as entertainment. I want to be a part of that future, and the Reality Virtually hackathon is the next step for me to take to make the next great innovation.","Rochester Institute of Technology, BS Game Design and Development","Wakefield, MA 01880",@NIebba,Virtuo Studios,,unity,,,googleVR,oculusRift,,,,,steamOpenVR,,,,,,oculusGo,,,,,,,Caucasian/Italian,,A group I belong to,,

We are branching into a new era, healthcare is more susceptible to innovation than at any other time in history, and I will be part of it. I strongly believe in the potential to transform the way we treat illnesses. Bringing technology to those who need it the most is my biggest aspiration. I think VR/AR is an incredible tool for making that possible, and I have a deep interest for learning more about it and seeing its applications. I would also be interested in any other field (not only healthcare) that improves someone's life or changes a reality in this world. I have attended several health hackathons, where I have been faced with challenges from different areas, and, with multidisciplinary teams, we have reached solutions. I´m also very creative (I have attended short film hackathons and won prizes, and I also have a photography and drawing blog on instagram- whateyelive and whateyedraw), so I can also help in the design/video/sound area, besides engineering and product development.

At my current job at WeWork, we’ve been exploring the idea that buildings = physical APIs, and how to show this informational link through AR/VR technology. Kind of related to this, I was a researcher at Harvard Center of Green Buildings and Cities before, and my primary project was to visualize live sensory data like temperature, humidity, and fluid dynamics in Microsoft Hololens. It centered around data visualization, but the new level of user interaction through gesture control and voice command really opened tremendous potential.

Aside from visualizing unseen things in AR/VR, I’ve also dabbled into scenarios where AR/VR technology could be useful for live feedback analysis. Still at Harvard, we built a structural analysis tool using Kinect and HTV Vive to track user’s body gesture and perform live structural analysis on bones. The (exaggerated) results were rendered through deformation shader to help user raise awareness of daily gesture and interaction with load around us.

Through these prior work and engagement with local AR/VR communities, I’m optimistic that AR/VR technology will eventually find fertile ground in not just gaming and entertainment, but other areas such as the built environment, healthcare, and education. A strong community is ever so important for us to get there, and I’ve been attending various Hackathons and events to stay connected with fellow comrades and the community at large. I went to the Creating Reality Hackathon at USC in March and I really enjoyed it (our team has also won a small prize, so that also helped), and I hope to replicate that experience again, and get inspired through idea exchange, prototyping, and hacking.

I am currently a part of Udacity’s AI Programming with Python course and recently completed the Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. This was funded by AT&T’s Aspire to Tech scholarship.

My interest in VR was sparked about a year ago. On my 16th birthday, a few friends and I went to VR world in NYC, and I had an amazing time. I got to see how people used VR to accomplish different tasks and experience firsthand the variety of ways in which users can interact with VR.

Last summer, I attended the MakeSchool Summer Academy, where I created an app for fencing, which is a passion of mine. I hope that through the use of VR, I will be able to create a software that will allow fencers to practice their technique at home or on the go, in addition to practicing to their clubs. Since many fencers live far away from their clubs, this is something that could help them, and also be useful during the holidays when there is no practice.

With my background as a director and choreographer, I have the insight and impulses to curate compelling audience interactions, purposeful choice making, and moments of spectacle. My work questions and investigates how social media and internet cultures have shifted our concepts of community and identity. Additionally, I am fascinated by the memeification of pop culture and our growing desire to express ourselves through collectively created images and vocabularies.

In the last year, I collaborated on FRANKENSTEIN AI, an immersive installation which premiered at Sundance. For this experience, I created choreography that was manipulated by an AI in real time based on how the audience responded to prompted questions and then performed by a human dancer. Currently, I’m working on two other AR projects exploring group choreography and CGI influencers.

Often, in the theatre and dance world, folks can be very anti-technology because they fear it will ruin the forms of the past. Instead, I believe that we should become educated in how the future is shifting around us and use our knowledge of storytelling to create more powerful and empathetic experiences. We are at an overwhelmingly exciting time for artists as these new forms and realities are being created. I believe it's up to us to lead the charge in rapidly shifting moment. Of course, we can’t do this alone. I’m excited to meet other creators who are as excited as me about the possibilities of collaborations between artists and technologists, as we have much to learn form each other.

Lastly, this event, with it’s combined educational programming and hands on creating opportunity, is perfectly suited to my learn by doing attitude. I couldn’t be more excited to join the community and explore the possibilities of new realities together.

Throughout my studies and in my lab jobs, I focus on human-computer interaction - specifically how we interact with and create media, and how to use media as a tool to promote accessibility. I also have a strong technical background; Computer Science was my minor and I’ve explored a variety of emerging technologies. The field that best encapsulates my worlds - design, art and coding - and has the most opportunity to make positive change is Extended Reality.
	Since I went straight from undergrad to graduate school, I haven’t had much of chance to develop my professional network outside of my job (I work as a Co-Creativity Research Intern at MIT’s Open Documentary Lab). Being a member of the Reality Virtually community would expose me to other people engaging in interesting XR projects. It would expose me to different ways of thinking about XR both technically and artistically. By meeting other students and industry professionals, I could have real conversations about the various applications of virtual reality and how to develop them further.
	My first 360 VR Project, Spoons —an immersive documentary designed to show users what life with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is like, to dispel myths and create empathy— was recently featured at the Frameless VR Symposium Expo. I want to build on this momentum and keep creating. Being invited to participate would allow me to do that with new perspectives.
	Ultimately, XR lives in the intersection of all the things I love and am good at. I see a massive potential for it to be a tool for change - especially in accessibility and human connection. I want to be a part of that change and being invited to join the Reality Virtually would be a massive step in that direction.","University of Rochester (graduated May 2018) - BA, Digital Media Studies; University of Edinburgh (current) - MsC Candidate, Design and Digital Media","New York City Metro, New York, United States",,University of Edinburgh (where I study); MIT Open Documentary Lab (where I work),,unity,vive,,,,vuforia,,,,,,,,,,,360video,,appleARKit,,,student,Latina Jew,,By Email,,

I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with coders translating minimalist 2D experiences into 3D.

I am drawn to a rich variety of projects. My illustration experience includes the New York Times, Conde Nast Traveler, the Atlantic, Spanish Vogue, an annual report in Germany, an exhibition in Japan, packaging for a video game in the US. I conceptualized and created the art for animated TV commercials in the US and in Italy. For the latter I had production experience as well. I also published a book “Hands Feet and Love” in Austria using die cuts to tell a story.

I’ve worked as a minimalist graphic designer for clients large and small including for branding, restaurants, non-profits and educating people about environmental issues via park signage in a project funded by the EPA.

Among my more unusual projects, In 2013 I created with a blind from birth Berklee classical pianist an original experience which we performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Three sighted musicians reacted to my digitally created live drawing that was transmitted to a giant stage sized screen as I simultaneously reacted to their music. The blind pianist could make out my presence as clearly as if I was another musician by the missing pull and push of the elements the others improvised to.

I have taught at Mass Art and guest lectured at the Museum School in Boston.

I am equally drawn to translating others’ ideas as my own to get across concepts more elegantly and eloquently and have enjoyed immersing myself in the VR community.

As a design researcher, the design thinking process has shown me the value of bringing in new voices to the process because of the unique perspective each individual provides. Simply by working with someone unexpected, you can increase your chances of developing a surprising and innovative solution.
I have worked in healthcare and financial industries, and would love to continue exploring how VR technology can be used in ways that provide real value to real people. From working on a project that used VR to re-imagine a patient waiting room to outlining a storyboard on how to use AR to help someone following a recipe, I’m most interested in how this technology can be used in a way that elevates the overall user experience. Rather than using “tech for tech’s sake,” I focus on identifying the core needs of people in order to determine how this technology could best serve someone by solving a real problem. Once I've identified the problem to solve, I draw on experience in business strategy, using tools such as the business model canvas to make sure the business is viable, in addition to being feasible and desirable.
I would love the opportunity to contribute to this hackathon as a business designer and design strategist. In addition to helping my team communicate effectively by helping create ‘quick and dirty’ paper prototypes and concept sketches, I would also serve as a strong advocate for the user and making sure the solution we develop is human-centered.

It’s the only thing I can hear 10 feet below the surface—a soothing hiss at 2-second intervals. I gaze at the tropical fish, indifferent to my presence, skillfully navigating through the coral. I swim to the surface, make eye contact with my sister, and we both smile as we’ve experienced something great.

If there’s one thing I know about myself, it’s that I love experiences. Scuba diving, haunted houses, walking in the woods, RPG games, or even walking through Costco or IKEA. I enjoy novelty, taking on challenges, and being at awe at creations.

And VR is all about experiences and making them more accessible. Whether that be learning more about the world, playing games, or creating simulations for training, all you have to do is put on a headset and walk around your living room.

So, VR excites me, and I want to get more involved in the space. And I think one of the best ways to do this is through community. I did this in college by joining clubs and attending hackathons. Community teaches standards and gives people resources to get started. People get inspired, find role-models, and meet people with similar interests and goals.

I believe that attending Reality Virtually Hackathon would be a great way for me to ramp up in this space! I’d love to start creating experiences and meeting people in the community.

In 300 words or less describe yourself and how you relate to immersive technologies


How can we(human) overcome our physical limitations in the reality?
Here is the main question that I have been looking for an answer.

I have been fascinated with limited abilities of human-being in the real world. We usually have five-senses and live in a physical world. Every day we wake up in a bed, in the room surrounded by walls. We talk, watch, eat, and sleep in the space and in the city. People get into space, look at the drawings, touch the material, and feel the space. I believe this is a general reality where we live in. However, there are a number of hidden stories in the limited reality that we cannot watch, feel and touch with from limited abilities of the human and insufficient capacity of physical space. I would like people to interact with the invisible and untouchable experiences by merging analog objects with Augmented Reality in reality.

 Moreover, I have been interested in serving the minority who has insufficient and limited physical and psychological abilities. They have been stuck in restricted reality, not properly utilizing their abilities. I would love to design a service which enables them to exceed their abilities by using AR and VR technologies.

In my previous life, working and studying in architecture and HCI industry, I spent a great number of years on numerous design projects. These projects ranged from the theoretical and conceptual to the practical
and tangible. My focus was on designing ‘integrated experiences’ on a physical and spatial level, and I had designed a variety of experiences in different contexts","The University of Suwon(BS, Architectural Design) / New York University(MPS.

A side-project and true passion of mine has to do with building software for wearable displays. I believe this will be the perfect opportunity for the first generation of effective memory augmentation software. An early prototype I built acted as an always-on virtual assistant of sorts. Going about your regular day, the software listened to your speech and passively queried your personal notes database for relevant information, that would then be displayed in the corner of your eye.
This is to honor a role-model of mine, Thad Starner, who built an early crappy version of this at MIT Media Lab 20 years ago named the Remembrance Agent. (link: http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/Papers/remembrance.html)

I am a senior at USC studying communications with a focus in communication technologies and computer programming. I've participated in a handful of VR/AR hackathons in LA and love meeting other people with similar interests and getting that creative outlet to build something new while learning new skills. In the past, I've helped mainly with the storytelling, user experience, and some design and Unity development (although those are more beginner level skills that I’d love to improve on).

At USC, I am the president of our VR/AR club (VRSC). With the support of VRSC, a team including myself built an experimental HoloLens project called ARnold. ARnold is a mixed reality story about a dog as he grows up in your environment. Depending on the furniture in the room, the dog interacts differently with the room and crafts distinct stories. We were fascinated by how real people interacted with this virtual dog.

While I am still a student, I have a lot of experience working in the VR/AR industry. At UploadVR, I worked as an education producer and marketing coordinator, helping build our VR/AR curriculum and education program. This past summer, I was a digital marketing intern at Magic Leap. Additionally, I recently became the CMO at a VR/AR startup called Across Realities. We are close to launching our flagship experience, Spatiate, which is a collaborative drawing application that works across major platforms including Magic Leap, HoloLens, iOS, Android, and Oculus.

I would love the opportunity to participate in this hackathon.

I backed the original Oculus Rift on Kickstarter back in the day, and I have been in love with this new medium ever since. Some call AR/VR a fad, but in my mind, XR gives us a whole extra dimension to work in while interfacing with computers. What that means for the potential of interacting with computers in more natural, less friction filled ways can hardly be overstated. I love making weird interactive music machines in VR because I can make an entire virtual space into a musical instrument with whatever whimsical interface I can dream up. At the same time, I am a professional software developer that can see how fundamentally limiting it is to interface with powerful software through the bottle neck that is a couple flat screens. I ran the rapid prototyping lab at a global advertising firm for five years which was kind of like participating in a hackathon every day. My skillsets cover the spectrum of tools that one needs to create VR/AR experiences, including things like 3d modeling, scene layout, scripting, networking, and physical fabrication using fanciness like arduino’s, laser cutters, 3d printing, as well as old fashioned wood/metal/plastic working tools.

Out in the field, time is spent making repetitive spatial measurements (position, distance, size, count, etc.) with specialized tools. After returning to lab, these measurements are then analyzed with computer software. The questions are exciting, but the manual measurement and delayed analysis turn-around are often tedious, monotonous, and even prohibitive.

The spatial mapping/analysis capacities of AR devices like Magic Leap and HoloLens can be a a scientific tool.  We can help scientists ask quantitative, spatial questions and get answers back in a HUD-like fashion in real-time — a quantitative 'sixth sense'.  Devices of this sort will replace many specialized measurement tools in field science and enable a more organic scientific process, less disjointed by the discrete steps of measure->record->analyze.

I received my personal Magic Leap in September, and at this point, I’m immersed in developing this project.  My original motivation was personal:  I have a research question I’m passionate about and this tool would be very useful in addressing it.  Then, I realized the more general potential for helping scientists that do 3D spatial work.  My goal now is to develop an AR application that provides a modular toolkit for measuring, analyzing, and plotting spatial data.  Scientists can mix, match, and customize the various modules to meet the needs of their particular question and method.

You can see the current state of the project in the link attached to this form.  I’ll be working on it full-time until January.  Next steps include developing a user-interface as well as general function packages for…

-analysis/plotting

Born in Japan, I lived in Europe from 4 years old to 7 years old and stayed in Japan until 19 years old. Moved around different places both in Europe and Japan due to my father’s job. During my gap year, I traveled around the world and realized my mission was to create a sustainable society by combining liberal arts and technology. I am currently studying cognitive science and education at DePauw University. My study is financially supported by the Grewbancroft Foundation that assists future leaders of Japan to study at top-tier liberal arts colleges in the United States. Based on my upbringing, moving around different cultures and social classes, I found out how each person’s worldview is so different from each other. Also, by being a minority in various environments, rural England, rural Japan, and rural Indiana, I learned how people’s rejection to consider other’s reality results in increasing conflicts and dehumanization. Furthermore, awareness for sustainability is hindered by people’s worldview limited to their local context. Sustainability is a global issue that humanity is facing as a whole. However, increasing conflict between people with different realities is preventing cooperation and collaboration on a global scale. I believe that people need to establish global citizenship and nurture moral responsibilities based on shared global reality. The Internet has allowed that to a certain degree. However, immersive technology has a much greater potential for shared reality because of how it allows people to experience a different reality. It will allow people to intuitively understand how people have different realities allowing people to become more empathetic and open to different realities. I am interested in immersive technologies because it’s a key to global level cooperation and collaboration essential for creating a sustainable society.

Most of my projects emphasis the idea of putting the user in a unique world, where they are offered a lot of agency to explore and experiment with the game's mechanics. In addition, I have a strong background in game design, programming, and developing 2D/3D assets.

Recently, i have been passionately involved in developing apps that gamify existing tools. For example, during the summer i prototyped a gamified calendar app that helps autistic college students organize their daily life. Overall, I would love to extend this type of design framework into virtual worlds using AR and VR.

Overall, I want to use my experience as a game designer, to create tools in AR/VR that can help people solve problems or gamify mundane tasks.

After an in-depth conversation with a Reality Virtually team member, I was struck by the synergistic approach to immersive creation that the conference seeks to take. In a team, I am most comfortable in an experience design role. By bringing the user’s voice into the creative conversation, I enable cross-functional teams to align on user-centric goals.

Currently, I am leading the user research programs for two Adobe initiatives: firstly, the recently-announced iPad Photoshop, which aims to enable a fluidly mobile experience of Adobe’s most widely used application. Second, I lead strategic user research for Adobe’s VR initiatives. In this role, I partner with VR designers, engineers, researchers, and product managers to conduct user studies (ranging from ethnographic user research to iterative usability studies) that inform the company’s VR strategy. In addition to this work, I am a member of the Sensor Design team, which seeks to provide a design language that accounts for all of the five senses as emerging technology becomes increasingly more immersive– and, subsequently, more sensory.

Working at Adobe puts me in a unique position: I design tools for designers. For this reason, I am deeply embedded in creative workflows, and I’m fluent in get-it-done needs. As a member of the Reality Virtually community, I would be able to conceive of projects uniquely-poised to answer market needs, analyze opportunities within target populations, synthesize large amounts of sensory input data, advocate user-centric priorities in engineering conversations, and flesh out complex problems and ideas.

While working and studying in this field I have identified many problems related to the built environment that I think VR/AR are uniquely capable of solving. This ranges from understanding ADA code in an autobiographical manner, to unveiling the metrics and underlying data of the architecture that already exist around us in order to start designing better buildings and spaces in the future.

While I have experience scripting in Unity, creating WebVR/AR experiences with JavaScript in A-Frame, and have created live demos for HTC Vive/Oculus, I feel as a designer I have much more to contribute to the look and feel of a project, as well as the underlying design concepts and project direction. In my current role as a 3D Visualization Designer, it is one of my key responsibilities to understand new and upcoming technologies that relate to methods of understanding and representing architecture. In this position I have explored many software and hardware workflows including projection mapping systems, interactive graphics on touch interfaces, and virtual/augmented realities.

My main goal in joining the Reality Virtually Community is to learn and to share. I feel that there are many misconceptions about how to improve and change the built environment both inside and outside the industry. It is often difficult to accept that sometimes it is more important to design at the scale of a doorknob than at the scale of a building.

Coming to Davidson College and working at Dr. Tabitha Peck's lab completely shifted my perspective.

With its potential, VR could revolutionize how we treat implicit racial bias and many more problems that our society faces today.

I am really excited about the possibilities of using augmented and virtual reality to further transform the automotive landscape - in tools, marketing, and full customer features. My company (an autonomous driving software development firm) has expertise in machine vision and SLAM - it is really cool to see similar concepts being used in augmented and virtual reality.

Some ideas I'd like to bring to this hackathon include exploring sensor (Lidar / Radar)  visualization, calibration, and design in augmented reality. I have had some exposure to the magic leap one headset (via a 3 hour developer workshop) and I think the complex shape mesh reconstruction enabled by this hardware may allow for some really novel use cases.

As a fan of AR/VR I’m also really excited to interact with other developers in this space and learn about all different types of new applications that these type of experiences allow for.

Although there are many forms that effective technology can take, I believe that some of the best most effective ones are the ones that humans don't even realize are there.

This is particularly true in the field of healthcare where the fluidity of the technology and user interface can be the deciding factor of whether it is ultimately used in the hospital, by clinicians, and by patients alike. Furthermore, healthcare - a field that interacts constantly with the most complex system (humans) involves a lot of 'simulation'. Surgeons pre-plan operations and simulate pathways. Patients alike simulate undergoing procedures through education. Medical students gain hands on skills through a variety of simulations in realistic clinical environments. Physical anatomical models simulate realistic haptic feedback. The list goes on but suffice to say that the more realistic/immersive these simulation become, the better the learning experience/overall outcome for clinicians, medical trainees, and patients alike.

Although I am interested in all ways of using immersive technologies to augment healthcare, I am particularly interested in education for medical trainees and patients alike. With healthcare costs rising exponentially with no slowing down in sight and with immersive technologies on the rise, I see an opportune time and opening to use such technologies to enable trainees and patients to become more independent of the hospital and system to alleviate burden and improve overall outcomes/well-being.

The entire process, from sketching and brainstorming to developing prototypes and building out 3D assets and finally integrating everything together with code is an ultimate combination of my natural loves: an innate mind for cutting-edge technologies with a broad creative streak guiding my experimentation.

My vision is to collaborate with other spatial computing artists, developers, and designers to create social experiences that connect users both in the real and digital world using media, art, and user-generated content in new and exciting ways that challenge the boundaries of traditional media.

Working in media, it has been enlightening to learn and experience how traditional media companies are approaching new techniques for interactive and immersive content, but it has proven difficult to find nascent communities of like-minded developers and creators to collaborate with and challenge my skills and expand my abilities.

It would be an honor to join the Reality Virtually Community, and an experience I believe would help me to meet other creators and continue on my journey to becoming a full-time immersive artist and developer.","New York University, Bachelor's of Music",New York,@nicksavarese,VICE Media,https://drive.google.com/a/realityvirtuallyhack.com/file/d/1h16JMijm4TOeilTKY29wi5yF9v6YbhKZ/view?usp=drivesdk,,vive,unrealEngine,googleVR,oculusRift,,arCore,,magicLeap,steamOpenVR,,,,,,,360video,,appleARKit,,,,White,,Word of mouth,,

I am passionate about engaging interactive experiences, skilled with rapid ideation and software prototyping. I view myself as a surrealist and a visionary who introduces people to a new world that lies between the physical and virtual space. To realize my vision, I incorporate mixed reality technology to tell a story to audience in the most immersive manner. I recently graduated from ITP, NYU where I explored the magical intersection of art and technology, and where I met the field of mixed reality that mesmerized me since then. I created many AR and VR projects while at ITP, and now that I am working at Walt Disney Company as a design technologist, I am actively involved in mixed reality community, brainstorming how to tell stories more magically and efficiently through AR and VR. I strive not only to keep myself up to date on cutting edge technology, but also to find a right cause where mixed reality can be used to create a better experience.
